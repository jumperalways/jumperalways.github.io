        <em>Miserere</em> is an atypical yume nikki fangame created by <em>owl</em>. The dream world is HUGE, and absolutely abysmal. You collect <strong>items</strong>, NOT effects in this game. Visit the <a target="_blank"  href="https://yumenikkifg.fandom.com/wiki/Miserere">official fandom wiki page</a> for download info among other things. However there is no substantial amount of info on fandom to help you crack the game. Hopefully this pet project will help you through <em>Miserere</em>. Enjoy the game!

      The game can be divided into <strong>2 stages</strong>. You have to clear the 1st stage (namely <strong>Dream World 1</strong>) to proceed to the 2nd stage (<strong>Dream World 2</strong>). The 1st stage is more about exploring the dream world, collecting items and helping NPCs. In the 2nd stage, you will find out more about the past of protagonist. <em>Miserere</em> does have a strong storyline compared to other ynfgs.

    <div id="reality-world">
      <h2>Reality World</h2>
      <p>The red-haired protagonist lives in space station(?). You first wake up in the living room. The room will have subtle changes as you make progress in the game. There are two bedrooms where you can sleep, the one next to the living room, and the one in the utility room. </p>
      <p>At first, you can only sleep in <strong>Bedroom 1</strong> and explore Dream World 1. After you have cleared stage 1, you will sleep in <strong>Bedroom 2</strong> to visit Dream World 2.</p>

    <div id="dream-world-1">
      <h2>Dream World 1</h2>
      <p>Dream world 1 is pretty conventional (layout-wise). The Nexus has 4 doors for access to numerous sub-worlds, and as you progress you will unlock 2 portals as well.</p>
      <p>The ultimate goal is to collect all doll parts and give them to the old lady in Paradise World. She will let you through to The Hole (marked by a star on the map) to unlock Dream World 2.</p>
      <p>You still need to visit Dream World 1 in stage 2 to see some buried memories. That would be in the cauldron room (accessible from Floating Light World).</p>

      <p>Dream World 2 starts off in a leaky apartment. There are 2 doors marked 1 and 2, the first leading to a rusty building, and the second leading to the sewers.</p>
